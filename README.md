# Vifer Bot

## About
This is a simple repository with the code for a bot I made for a close friend and amazing streamer, [Vifer](https://www.twitch.tv/vifer).

You can use the '$random' command when the bot is linked to your server to send a randomized part of an Arknights character for you to guess.

## Technologies used
- Python
    - Discord.py
